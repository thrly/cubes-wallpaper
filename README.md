# ðŸ§Š cubes â€“ a catppuccin-themed wallpaper pack

A minimalist wallpaper pack featuring **procedurally generated stacking cubes**, created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and coloured with the beautiful [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette.

Each wallpaper is rendered at **1920x1080** resolution in both **landscape** and **portrait** orientations -- for dual-monitor setups, desktops, or vertical displays.
