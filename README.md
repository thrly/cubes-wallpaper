# ðŸ§Š cubes â€“ a catppuccin-themed wallpaper pack

A minimalist wallpaper pack featuring **procedurally generated stacking cubes**, created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and coloured with the beautiful [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette.

Each wallpaper is rendered at **1920x1080** resolution in both **landscape** and **portrait** orientations -- for dual-monitor setups, desktops, or vertical displays.

_Sample: Catppuccin Mocha palette with isometric cube stack_

- `landscape-colours/` and `landscape-mono/` â€“ 1920x1080 horizontal wallpapers
- `portrait-colors/` and `portrait-mono` â€“ 1080x1920 vertical wallpapers
- `.png` format

All images are generated using randomized seeds â€” no two are exactly alike.

- Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- Catppuccin Mocha colour theme
- Grid-based procedural layout

This project was inspired by isometric cube stacks, procedural design, and the calming tones of the Catppuccin theme.

If you'd like to generate your own variations, check out the `/sketch/` folder containing the original p5.js source files.

Or you can tweak and generate your own version with the p5.js web editor: <https://editor.p5js.org/thrly/sketches/JFO5uldxb>
